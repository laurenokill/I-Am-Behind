        <h4>A few things about me...</h4>
        <p>Hiya, I'm Lauren! I recently graduated from my MA in Heritage Studies and I'm from Kent. I'm interested in space travel, museums, and protecting the environemnt.</p>
        <p>I had to finsish my MA in lockdown which was pretty weird, 300 miles away from my coursemates and the uni library. But that's all done, so now I'm looking for <i>literlly any job</i>.</p>
        <p>I'm learning coding to expand my skills, and help with the job hunting. Working in marketting for a museum is a job I'd love to have, and I think this will really help!</p>
        <p>Because I'm living at home, I've got my dog to keep me company!</p>
        <p>I also play dnd a lot, which has been great fun!</p>
        <p>Read more about my dnd character - on a much prettier website - <a href="page2.html" target="_blank"> here! </a></p>
