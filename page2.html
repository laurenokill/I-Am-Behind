        <h1> <b>Early life</b></h1>
        <p>Katerina Vosseri was born on the 10th Lancida 414, in a small fishing port on the north-east coast of Dethar called Ribarski. One step up from a village, Ribarski is home to less than 1000 people, predominantly humans, who make their living on the sea. Katerina's family are no different, her mother working on the fishing trawler 'Ribnaya'. Her father used to work on the same boat, but was injured in a great storm seven years ago and now works on the docks, signing in ships. They are both employees of Bogaty Chevlok, a rich businessman who lives in Camsir. His fishing business, Torgoya, employs the majority of the Ribarski people and without the money he pours into this impoverished community, many would starve. Life in Ribarski is hard, facing the harsh winters storms rolling off the Emberhead Sea and living off the near unfertile land surrounding the area - conditions that did not exactly agree with Katerina. A beautiful young woman with a talent for deception and an appetite for wealth, Katerina decided at a young age that she was going to get out of Ribarski and find a better life for herself in a sunnier corner of the Empire. And, in a world like this, the only way she knew how was by finding a rich husband. </p>
        <p>Primed to join the crew of the ‘Ribnaya’ when she came of age (her 16th birthday), Katerina had been in training with her mother on how to sail and catch fish since she was tall enough to see over the bulkheads. While no means an enthusiastic student, Katerina saved the little money she earnt from this (2cp a day) to purchase the supplies necessary for her escape: A well-made gown, a ticket on a carriage, and illegally forged documents claiming to belong to Vanya Nevinkova.  For all the skills she lacked in fishing, Katerina was a more than convincing actor when she needed to be, and her plan was to pass herself off as a lovely young woman from a noble family seeking an advantageous match. At the end of Ficare 430, two weeks before her 16th birthday, Katerina ran away from home, leaving nothing but a note reading: “Gone to make my own money and when I do, I promise I’ll come back for you all. We’ll find somewhere nicer to live where father can rest and Olena can train to be a healer. I love you! - K”. Taking nothing of her former life with her, save the second-hand fiddle her little sister had bought for her, Katerina left Ribarski and Vanya emerged into the world.</p>
